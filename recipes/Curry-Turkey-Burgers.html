    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, mango chutney, bread crumbs, dried onion, curry powder, ginger, garlic powder, and salt.
            Quarter the mixture and shape into 1/2-inch thick patties.
            
            
            
        </li>
        <li>
            Place patties in the freezer for 20 minutes to help them keep their shape and not fall apart on the grill.

            
            

        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly oil the grill grate and prepare an outside grill for medium-high heat.


        </li>
        <li>
            Cook turkey burgers on a prepared grill over direct heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear.
            At least 165 degrees F should be read on an instant-read thermometer put into the center (74 degrees C).
            Serve right away.
