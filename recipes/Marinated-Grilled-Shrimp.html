    <h1>Marinated Grilled Shrimp Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This marinade is so simple and easy to create that you won't even need cocktail sauce with your shrimp! Don't be alarmed by the cayenne pepper; you won't even notice it. My two and four-year-olds adore it, and they consume more shrimp than their parents! It's also a tremendous hit with guests and simple to make. If the weather isn't cooperating, I cook this with frozen or fresh shrimp on an indoor electric grill. Serve with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread as a side dish. You will not be let down!!!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato sauce </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li> 
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>2 pounds fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined </li>
        <li>6 each skewers </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the garlic, olive oil, tomato sauce, and red wine vinegar in a large mixing bowl.
            Add basil, salt, and cayenne pepper to taste.
            Stir the shrimp in the bowl until they are equally coated.
            Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring every 30 minutes or so.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the grill to medium.
            Using skewers, thread shrimp onto them, piercing them once near the tail and once near the head.
            Remove the marinade and discard it.
            

        </li>
        <li>
            Grease the grill grate lightly.
            Cook shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side on a hot grill, or until opaque.
